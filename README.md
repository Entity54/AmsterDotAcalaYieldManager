We have created two types of smart contracts

Firstly  we needed a form of staking income so the user could stake for example his DOT and receive ACA which he would then either swap for AUSD and keep as income or swap for another coin e.g. DOT or LDOT to dollar cost average

Due to the current state of the testnet Acala Mandala TC7 it has not beeing possible to use stakign DOT for LDOT or claimRewards from any of the availabel pools

Therefore we have created a staking smart contract where for DOT that are staked it pays ACA


In addition we created a smart contract stategy that autmates the yield collection of ACA and swaoing it for AUSD before transfering it to the user
